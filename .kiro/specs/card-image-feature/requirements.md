# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to add images to cards and display them within the card interface. Users will be able to upload, attach, and view images as part of their card content, enhancing the visual representation and information density of cards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add images to my cards, so that I can include visual content alongside text information.

2. WHEN a user selects the add image option THEN the system SHALL allow file upload from local device
3. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL validate the file type (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
4. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL validate the file size is under 5MB
5. IF the uploaded file is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN a valid image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store the image and associate it with the card

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see images displayed in my cards, so that I can quickly view visual content without opening separate files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a card contains an image THEN the system SHALL display the image within the card layout
2. WHEN displaying an image THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio and fit within card boundaries
3. WHEN an image is too large for the card THEN the system SHALL provide a thumbnail view with click-to-expand functionality
4. WHEN a user clicks on a thumbnail image THEN the system SHALL display the full-size image in a modal or overlay
5. WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL show a loading state while images are being fetched

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage images in my cards, so that I can update or remove visual content as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a card has an attached image THEN the system SHALL provide options to replace or remove the image
2. WHEN a user chooses to replace an image THEN the system SHALL allow uploading a new image file
3. WHEN a user removes an image THEN the system SHALL delete the image from storage and update the card
4. WHEN a user removes an image THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before deletion
5. IF image deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and maintain the current state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to load efficiently, so that my card interface remains responsive and fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading cards with images THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for images not in viewport
2. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL show placeholder or skeleton loading states
3. WHEN image loading fails THEN the system SHALL display a broken image placeholder with retry option
4. WHEN multiple images are present THEN the system SHALL optimize loading order based on viewport visibility
5. WHEN images are stored THEN the system SHALL generate and cache optimized thumbnails for card display
